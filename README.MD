# DRAFT


Instead of writing loads of documentation we've decided to provide you with examples of code snippets
shown in code. 
Each code snippet class is annotated with @Example annotation. 
Please bear in mind that any other code that is not used in @Example annotated class is not adviced to be used for 
it is probably not for public use and will be mercilessly modified in its interface part or completely removed. 
Also note that any other public code that is not annotated with >>> @Api() <<< is also free to be modified or removed.
