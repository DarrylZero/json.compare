Instead of writing loads of documentation we've decided to provide you with examples of snippets
left in example code. 

Each code snippet class is annotated with @Example annotation. 
(com.steammachine.common.definitions.annotations.Example)

Please bear in mind that any other code that is not shown in @Example annotated class is not advised to be used for 
it is probably not for public use and will be mercilessly modified in its interface part or completely removed. 

Also note that any other parts of public are free to be modified or removed.
unless not annotated with @Api(State.MAINTAINED) or @Api(State.INCUBATING)
