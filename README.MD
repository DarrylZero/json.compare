Instead of writing loads of documentation we have decided to provide you with examples of snippets shown in example code. 

Each example code snippet is annotated with @Example annotation. 
(com.steammachine.common.definitions.annotations.Example). And therefore can be found 

Please bear in mind that any parts of code (classes, methods, fields) are free to be modified or removed
unless annotated with @Api(State.MAINTAINED) or @Api(State.INCUBATING)

Take a look at the class com.steammachine.jsonchecker.examples.Examples to start with
